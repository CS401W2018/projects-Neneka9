        <p>I love watching <span class="attention">Japanese dramas</span>. When my mom and I eat dinner at home, we always watch those and enjoy that time. </p>
        <p>I cannot say what I like the most because I watched a lot and there are a lot of good ones. However, since I came to Hawaii, I don't have time to watch any of new dramas. So, whenever I talk to my mom on the phone, I ask her brief sotries.</p>
