        <h2>— Can anyone do snorkeling? —</h2>
        <p>Yes. I don't really know how to swim, but I can go snorkeling.</p>
        <p>However, you should practice using a mask, snorkel, and fins. Even if you're not a beginner at swimming, it's a good idea to practice beforehand. If you're with children, choose snorkeling spots that are not too deep.</p>

        <p>The famous snorkeling spots are on the west side, along the Kona Coast. The more details are from <a href="https://uprootedtraveler.com/the-big-island-snorkeling/">here</a></p>
