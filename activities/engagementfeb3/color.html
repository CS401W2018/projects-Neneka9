        <h3>List out the different ways to select an item.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>tag name</li>
            <li>Descendent rule (parent and children (children is inside of parent))</li>
            <li>ID</li>
            <li>class</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class</h3>
        <p>ID is to identify the name. It's an attribute. It can be used only once. It should be unique, not duplicated. (use less) generally, we should put a noun to name</p>
        <p>Class can be named more than 1 tag. 1 tag can have more than 1 class. generally, we should put an adjective to name</p>
        <h3>3. What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h3>
        <p>SPAN doesn't show any changes on the webpage. You can put class in it. You can put span tag in the sentence. Span tag doesn't cause the line break.</p>
        <p>DIV tag causes the line break.</p>
        <h3>4. What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</h3>
        <p>DIV tag is not a semantic and can include the class to name.</p>
        <p>However, the others are semantic. They have their clear meaning for each tag.</p>
        <h3>5. What are the different ways to select a color?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>name</li>
            <li>.rgb (You need to choose each color, red,  green, blue, from 0 to 255)</li>
            <li>Hex code (2 numbers stand for each color, red, green, blue)</li>
            <li>short code</li>
            <li>HSL</li>
        </ul>
