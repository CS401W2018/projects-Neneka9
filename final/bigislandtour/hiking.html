        <h2>— Where is a good hiking spot? —</h2>
        <p>I know many people might have the same question, since there are so many hiking spots on the Big Island. I totally get your confusion—each place offers a different view, like the ocean, volcanoes, ponds, or even deserts.</p>
        <p>This <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/lists/hawaii-big-island-hikes">website</a> makes it easy to find a spot you might be interested in. You can compare different trails by length, difficulty level, and check out other people’s comments.</p>

        <p>I want to share a spot on the island called the White Road Hike. It’s a great place to experience nature and maybe even spot some wildlife. A lot of people head there to check out the natural waterslide at the end. After a long walk, you can enjoy sliding down in your swimsuit!</p>
        <p>However, it's a dangerous hike, and there’s no cell phone service along the way. If you get hurt, you'll have to rely on yourself for help. The area is protected by the DLNR (Department of Land and Natural Resources). Although it used to be open and many people hiked there in the past, it’s now off-limits, and trespassing is not allowed.</p>

        <p class="causion"><em>Before you hike, make sure to stretch properly and stay safe throughout the whole hike!</em></p>
