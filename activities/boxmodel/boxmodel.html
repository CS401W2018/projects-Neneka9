        <h2>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h2>
        <p>Block tag has 100% width. The height is as height as the content. Those can change the size with CSS. (Ex. Div, header, nav, footer, main, h1-6, p, UL, OL, Li, etc)</p>
        <p>The space of Inline tag is just around the text (Ex. Span, em, strong, b, I, a, img, etc)</p>
        <h2>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
        <p>Margin is the outside (around) box (how much space you want around the box)</p>
        <p>Padding is the inside of the box (how much space you want between text and border)</p>
        <p>Border is a line around the text</p>
        <h2>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
        <p>Sized: px, thin, in, cm</p>
        <p>relative: 50%, 0.5 em</p>
        <h2>When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
        <p>causes break line (Ex. to put the image between the text)</p>
